var Taylor = Artist(name: "Taylor Swift", profileImage: "Taylor1", descriptionImage: "Taylor2", description: #"Taylor Alison Swift, born December 13th, 1989, is an american Singer-Songwriter famous for her narrative storytelling and confessional lyrics. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to persue a carreer in music. Starting in country music, Swift began her journey with her self-titled album in 2006, she reached stardom with her next album's (Fearless) singles, "You Belong With Me" and "Love Story". After the second album acclaim, she adventured in a more pop oriented sound with her third and fourth albums, "Speak Now" and "Red". In 2014, she went full pop with the album "1989", which cimented her as a part of popular culure. She followed the tremedous sucess with "reputation", which told the story of her cancelation in the summer of 2016 and how her personal life and self-image was affected by the occurence. With singles like "Look what you made me do" and "End Game", Swift changed her sound from a maximalist pop to a more urban and dark atmosphere. In full contrast, "Lover", her next album was filled with songs with a happier and more energetic beats, seen in the singles "You Need To Call Down" and "Cruel Summmer". With the the Lover tour not being able to star, Swift changed her sound once more to fit the situation the world was facing. Her music became calmer, retrospective and folk-like in Folklore and Evermore, granting her a level of acclamation never seen before. Singles like "Cardigan" and "Willow" showed a different side of her to the public. Now, Swift has a new album returning to pop, "Midnights", but with a mixture of the folk sound she mastered in her previous work; and two of rerecordings of her previous works. Breaking records at every time she releases a new album, Taylor Swift has made herself part of the history of american music."# , musics: [Music(title: "Anti-Hero", time: "3:24", image: "Taylor3"), Music(title: "Bejeweled", time: "3:15", image: "Taylor3"), Music(title: "Lavender Haze", time: "3:31", image: "Taylor3"), Music(title: "Midnight Rain", time: "2:59", image: "Taylor3")],favorite: false, tourName: "The Eras Tour", tour: #"The Eras Tour is the ongoing sixth headlining concert tour by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.
